    "### Nets, Layers, and Blobs, the anatomy of a Caffe model\n",
    "- Caffe defines a net layer-by-layer in its own model schema. The network defines the entire model bottom-to-top from input data to loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As data and derivatives flow through the network in the forward and backward passes Caffe stores, communicates, and manipulates the information as blobs: the blob is the standard array and unified memory interface for the framework.\n",
    "- The layer comes next as the foundation of both model and computation. \n",
    "- The net follows as the collection and connection of layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Blobs\n",
    "- Caffe stores and communicates data using blobs. Blobs provide a unified memory interface holding data; e.g., batches of images, model parameters, and derivatives for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The conventional blob dimensions for batches of image data are number N x channel K x height H x width W. Blob memory is row-major in layout, so the last / rightmost dimension changes fastest. For example, in a 4D blob, the value at index (n, k, h, w) is physically located at index ((n * K + k) * H + h) * W + w.\n",
    "    - Number N is the batch size\n",
    "    - Channel K is the feature dimension, for RGB images K = 3\n",
    "    \n",
    "- a Blob stores two chunks of memories, data and diff. The former is the normal data that we pass along, and the latter is the gradient computed by the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Layer computation and connections\n",
    "- The layer is the essence of a model and the fundamental unit of computation. Most of the types needed for state-of-the-art deep learning tasks are there.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A layer takes input through bottom connections and makes output through top connections.\n",
    "- Each layer type defines three critical computations: setup, forward, and backward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Net definition and operation\n",
    "- The net jointly defines a function and its gradient by composition and auto-differentiation.\n",
    "- The net is a set of layers connected in a computation graph – a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to be exact.\n",
    "- The net is defined as a set of layers and their connections in a plaintext modeling language. \n",
    "- The models are defined in plaintext protocol buffer ([Google Protocol Buffer](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/)) schema (`prototxt`) while the learned models are serialized as binary protocol buffer (binaryproto) `.caffemodel` files.\n",
